# The following function adds information about supplementary variables to any already constructed biplot
# It may serve to add the variables to a  Principal Coordinates Analysis (or MDS)
# in order to build a biplot. Unless specified, numerical variables are added with linear regression, 
# factors with logistic biplots, frequencies with weighted averages and abundances with gaussian regression. 
# If the type of variable is not specified the program tries to guess.
# The type of Variable can be specified in a vector TypeVar and the type of fit in a vector TypeFit. 
# If fitting types are not supplied, default values for each type are used
