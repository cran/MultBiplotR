\details{
Plots a biplot for binary data. The Biplot for binary data is taken as the basis of the plot. If there are a mixture of different types of variables (binary, nominal, abundance, ...) are added to the biplot as supplementary parts.

There are several modes for plotting the biplot.
"p".- Points (Rows and Columns are represented by points)

"a" .- Arrows (The traditional representation with points for rows and arrows for columns)

"b" .- The arrows for the columns are extended to both extremes of the plot and labeled outside the plot area.

"h" .- The arrows for the columns are extended to the positive extreme of the plot and labeled outside the plot area.

"ah" .- Same as arrows but labeled outside the plot area.

"s" .- The directions (or biplot axes) have a graded scale for prediction of the original values.
}
